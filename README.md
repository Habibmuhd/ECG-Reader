# ECG-Reader
University Project - Two Point ECG reader using Arduino

The purpose of this project was to create a medical device that can measure a parameter. A two point ECG machine (similar to Apple Watch's ECG) was created. Given that that the code was written onto the Arduino board a short Heartrate Algorithm was designed.
